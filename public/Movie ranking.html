<h1> The Best Movies According to Alex</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2><hr>
<h3>Across the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>I've always been a fan of Spider-Man. Ever since my mom got me the old Spider-Man series on VHS, it has been a staple for me.
    This movie is the best of the best for me. The conflicts and character interactions,
    the artstyle and creative direction, to the themes it handles, it is all top notch.
</p>
<h3>Star Wars Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith</h3>
<p> From the lightsaber duels, to the character designs, to the improved CGI, this movie has it all. 
    Although I am a fan of movies that have a happy ending, this one is done so well that it can overcome my bias. 
    Top it off with that excellent final battle and amazing music throughout the entire film and it is untouchable.
</p>
<h3>Get Out</h3>
<p>Man... What a thriller with such an excellent twist and an unexpected ending. The themes and motifs handled in this movie along with the
    excellent acting by the entire cast made this one such an impactful film for me. Not to mention it is terrifying.

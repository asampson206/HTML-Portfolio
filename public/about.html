<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Well, it's been a long road trying to figure out what profession I want to fund my life style. I've never felt there was a dream job out there for me.
  I can't think of a job that is more fun than hanging out with my friends or going on dates. But I wanted to find something that I was good at because I hate not getting things.
  So here I am at coding! Where not getting things is step 1 of the job! Turns out I'm pretty good at not getting things.
  But, we'll see how it all goes and if this doesn't work out... Can always turn to crime!
